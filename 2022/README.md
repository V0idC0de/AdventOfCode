# Advent of Code

Contains my solutions to "[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)" of 2022,
along with my inputs for all challenges.

Some tasks were solved in sub-optional ways, utilizing techniques that might be _a little bit_
overkill for the computation problem presented, but the whole thing wasn't competitive anyway,
primarily a learning experience and some tasks were structured in a way that allowed me
to put rarely used functions like `map()` or `reduce()` to good use.

This alone was a ton of fun, especially because I like the functional style of them,
but hardly get the chance to utilize them properly. Same goes for a couple other programming
techniques, which just aren't useful in day-to-day scenarios.

## Requirements

Python 3.9+ (no additonal packages required)
