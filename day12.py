    Heavily inspired by https://github.com/clrfl/AdventOfCode2023/blob/master/12/part2.py.
    Tried for many hours to implement a more optimized version of part 1, which ended up working, but still took
    (predicted) an hour or something to complete.
    Manageable, but obviously not a nice choice - however, I couldn't think of more optimizations.
    The NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton) solution was super smart, using a completely different approach and
    I was quite impressed and frustrated, since I didn't understand why it worked, at first.
    After thinking about it for a while, I fiddled with my own NFA implementation and ended up with a very similar
    solution. I spared the leading "." at `states` however - still don't understand what it is used for.
